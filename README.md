# java-BLAST-to-GO

Contig processing from BLAST data, original attempts in java. This was some of the code I wrote to practice programming during my first year at university back in 2012/13. Additionally, I was writing this code (and the [perl-NCBI-Blast](https://github.com/SamuelHill/perl-NCBI-Blast) code) in preparation for my summer job as a research assistant at the University of Richmond.

Not the original version used, no guarantees.
